- To start sending tokens, use the below command
```bash
node bot.js
```
- After running at the last stage it will ask `‚õΩ Use custom gas settings? (y/N)` ; if u want to use current gas fee then write `N` but if u want to use customized gas fee instead of current gas fee then u should write `y`
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- You need to enter the **private key** of the wallet from which you want to send tokens to other wallets.
- Choose the **Native Coin** option if you want to send gas tokens like **BNB, ETH, or IP**. If you want to send an **ERC-20 token**, you need to enter the **contract address** of that token.
- If the **network you want to use is not available**, you can edit the `chains.json` file and modify it with your preferred network.
